# ella
An broad library for common tasks like serialisation, classes for maths types, working with dates/times, object lifecycle management. Many classes derive originally from the excellent Closure Library.

Modifications have been made over time, much of Closure Library is not included, and there have been a lot of classes added which are original.

The Apache 2.0 license has been maintained to match that of the original work.
